## Reflection Questions
1. If you used any outside resources to help complete your submission (websites, books, people, etc) list them here. 

- Stackoverflow, geeksforgeeks, w3schools, various youtube channels. 

2. What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? How did you overcome it? (recommended 200 - 400 words) 

- The biggest challenge was being persistent when my code wasn't working or there was some bug in the program I couldn't fix. 
  Sometimes I would make really silly syntax mistakes. I would get stuck and stare at the screen thinking where I went wrong. 
  And not just syntax mistakes but thinking about how I will implement the code I am thinking in my head. Sometimes I just couldn't 
  figure where I went wrong. Especially when it came to the optional feature for the website I had think about every little detail 
  on where I could go wrong or How will this code make sense with that code. So it was a lot of thinking for hours. I wanted to keep 
  moving because I really wanted to finish the site. It took a lot of patience to keep trying on to fix my mistakes and finish what I 
  intended to. I overcome this difficulty by treating the problems like a game I wanted to beat. When I started thinking this submission as 
  a game I enjoyed but wanted to beat really badly. I was able to gain the mental power I needed to be persistent in solving my mistakes 
  and finish the submission. Only then I was able to do it with great enthusiasm and fun. 
 

3. What questions about web development do you have after completing your submission? (recommended 100 - 300 words) 

- I have many questions about web development. I know that Web developers need to know javascript very well but How much does someone 
  need to know before they can start building websites using frameworks. Also How many frameworks does a web developer needs to know 
  in order to be in demand. I am also very curious about what exactly the backend developers do and what they use to do their work. 
  I also want to know how web developers manage big data with hundreds or millions of users actively using their site. Also how does 
  web development take place in real time while there are users using the sites. 


4. If you had a few more hours to work on this project, what would you spend them doing (for example: refactoring certain functions, adding additional features, etc). Be specific. (recommended 100 - 300 words) 

- I would probably try to make the UI more stylish and more user responsive. I would try implement new UI elements to make it look
  more pleasant. Like I would try to implement an animation that would tell that user what they need to know exactly. It would vanish 
  when the user knows the information. I would also repositions certain UI elements to make it look good and use new background color 
  for every new guess. I would also like to use more CSS on site to create shadow and try to use boxes around certain elements. I would 
  i also like to make an animation to let the user know if they win or lose.
